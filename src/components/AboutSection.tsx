              I'm a Software Engineer with 1.6 years of experience at Cosmitude Softwares, specializing in Quality Assurance. 
              I bring a strong foundation in manual and automation testing, and have worked across multiple QA domains â€” from 
              web UI to pixel-level visual QA, ensuring every release meets the highest quality standards.

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-white mb-6">
              My expertise includes comprehensive testing frameworks using Selenium and Appium, API testing with Postman, 
              and cross-platform quality assurance. I've successfully implemented automated test suites that improved 
              testing efficiency by 60% and reduced regression testing time significantly.

              I'm passionate about delivering pixel-perfect user experiences and maintaining robust testing methodologies. 
              My approach combines technical precision with creative problem-solving to ensure comprehensive quality 
              coverage across web applications, mobile platforms, and API integrations.
